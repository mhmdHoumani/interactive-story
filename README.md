# Tarry And Mary's Adventure - Interactive Story

## About The Story

Tarry And Mary's Adventure is an interactive story written and designed by the "Hakuna Matata" team (Codi B08's cohort). The story is about Tarry and his sister Mary who were lost in the woods. There, they found a locked treasure box. After trying by all means to open the box, a genie appeared to them, and told them that they needed the key to open the box. One of them was allowed to take on this risk and look for the key, and this is when the suspense really begins!

## User's Interaction

In this interactive and entertaining story, the user is given the chance to control the way things go on, as well as the ending of the story based on the decisions he makes. Firstly, the user chooses the character that will go look for the key. Secondly, the user will choose where the character will search for the key. Then the user has to choose the room he wants the character to look in. The character(that is controlled by the user), will keep looking for the key, as long as he/she still has time and as long as he/she is not eaten by a wild animal and is escaping the traps. Finally, either the game will be over, or the key will be found, and the treasure box will be unlocked.
